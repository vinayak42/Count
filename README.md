# Count
A simple app to count things.
Download, the app from playstore: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.xyz123.count

I did this project to get an understanding of offline database (Room) in Android and syncing user data to Cloud Firestore (Firebase).
I hope you guys will like it.
